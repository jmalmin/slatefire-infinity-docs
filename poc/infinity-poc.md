Slate Fire **INFINITY** software will reduce man hours and associated costs significantly by automating the installation process, scheduling code migrations, comparing and verifying quality assurance and giving system project metrics to product owners. Product owners will make better decisions with INFINITY installed. Trend analysis will show the value of INFINITY over time and remove mistakes that are costly to project teams on day one.

> “I’ve learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success.”  
– Jack Welch, chairman and CEO General Electric

 The current Tririga installation process is manual, requires multiple teams, and many hours to complete each environment. Simplify this process for your teams with IPA. Scheduling object migrations between environments gives project teams the ability to focus on *work in progress*. Creating amazing functionality for the product owners will be the task of your current professional services teams with INFINITY configured and running OPA. Additionally the metrics(Fireball) for all activities related to Tririga are easily understood and reported to all team members using Sapphire reporting.

 - **IPA** software - Installation team members can redirect focus to projects and support issues in the Tririga system rather than manual installations.
 - **OPA** software - Automated migration of packages from source to destination server(s).
 - **Fireball** software - Monitor developer and system modification across all objects.
 - **Sapphire** - Reporting for all INFINITY modules and more.
 
> Solve problems quickly, fix issues as they occur and stay on top of

**Demo**

 Let's start with an example deployment of the infinity system. In our example we will simulate with a master server and two nodes. The first node will be a Windows computer the second will be a Lenox System it does not matter which one. 

Our deployment processes are as follows:

Plan

 The first thing that we would do would be to plan what how a deployment would look like.  We would take in consideration production metrics, production objects, and get feedback from meetings with the product owner on what are the desired processes to be included in our effort.

 Create Software
 
 In this process, we would be generate package or archives to be delivered from the master to the known servers.
 Configuration
 Configuration deployment steps would be contained here:

 Coding

**Team roles and responsibilites**
Establish the team that will be involved in training and rolling out the system. Assign roles and responsibilities and adjust any others that will occur as a result of the new system. Answer any questions team members have and bring them up to speed on any information you learned during the sales process that could be of value to them. Create a software implementation plan with predicted deadlines the company should be aware of.




Software. will be installed and team members will be five provided information on configurations in a software implementation plan with project deadlines will be created respect the project teams current timelines


**Configure the system**

ometimes software systems require adjustments to match your operations. That’s why having team members involved can help work through what needs to occur for the software to work with your operations. Whether it’s an integration with other software systems used in your business or custom feature development, time will need to be allocated to account for any configurations.  At other times, a software system can’t be configured specifically and therefore your business operations may need to be adjusted to match the software tools and the efficiencies they provide.


Configuration of the software Will need to be adjusted in respect to the project teams current needs the documentation the controller projects in other system configurations And operating system configurations can be different depending out with the project team meetings.
Is important to know that the project teams in the business owners will need to help dictate to the infinity software how to manage their projects while out of the box there can be's guesses and estimates created these can not be a good fit 100% a time for a customer. So it is expected that there will be Communication from the business owner to the infinity installation teams and that there will be additional customizations needed to make the software function better for the individual client.





**Change management**
This will help with coordination and implementation of the team and project: Change can be difficult for many staff. You can read more about how to manage your staff through change in our 8 steps for managing through change in ecommerce blog found here.

Change management that occurs wildly implementation of the software is occurring or during the project should be monitored and visibility to any System changes are operating system changes networking changes legal or other change management should be clear to all parties





**Training**

Most software companies will train the key person who will be handling the system. That person becomes the expert or “Power User” and then trains others in the company as needed. If you prefer to train all staff who would be involved at once, then check with the software provider on what training programs and roll outs they offer. Companies will have training documents available that you can use as reference. If there are some specific instructions that need to be developed for staff who may not use the system frequently, developing any training procedures/documents that are reflective of how you want your operations to run is a good starting point to ensure consistency in usage of the system.



After the initial installation of the system, the business owner and the project teams will be needing either a power user or training for the new system. Training for one or many Candy provided and it should be known that specific project creation in the controller software will be informed by what the current project teams are expecting to do or implement in the coming year.
To be understood that the infinity software is a project deb ops process that can be informed by the modules and what they are doing on a day-to-day basis, but they need to be agreed upon and configured again due to the projects needs. 

**Conduct UAT**

This is an important step to undertake to ensure the software works as intended. It will help find any bugs, (its software, it can happen). That’s why it’s important to test out a small portion of data to see if the software processes all the information correctly. If the system it integrated with other software tools or marketplaces you will want to ensure that the systems are communicating properly.

Agreed upon user acceptance testing is important to be informed by the current project teams and respect any existing UHT processes that might be in place. When at all possible into in testing for DataViz flowing analysis in which included integrations this should be done.

    enter code here

Consider thinking of defining the process for testing during UAT.

**Coordinate Cut-over**

When it’s time to begin to move to the new software it’s a good idea to keep existing system’s information with data still available. For a short period you may be running 2 systems depending on how you decided to roll out the new software. It can take 6-12 months for users to feel fully comfortable with system with a new pieces of software and most times the historical information will need to be accessible. Especially if you are selling online and have returns or warranties to account for.



**Plan for Go-live**
A good idea is to implement a system during slower periods of the year. When companies don’t have a slow time, then planning ahead to try to account of any bumps will help. Make sure to have the implementation team ready to work with your software provider on the go-live. Check random pieces of data to see that information and data has transitioned and is processing as it should.

**Track efficiencies and measure results**
With any system you want to measure the before and after effects. You also want to establish what measures will tell you the implementation has been successful. This can include things like the ability to process more orders in a day, reduction in hourly wages paid out for overtime, or others. Continue to track and measure through the year to make sure your investment is paying off. It’s also always nice to see the benefits and be reminded of how far you’ve come and grown your business.
